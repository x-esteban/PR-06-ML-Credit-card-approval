# Module 3 - Project 2 (ML) - Credit Card Approval


---


## Context ‚úè

The main aim of this project will be to build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. You should use some techique, such as vintage analysis to construct you label. Also, unbalanced data problem is a big problem in this task.

You can look further in Kaggle to understand the columns and the dataset structure: https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction

## Project aim ‚úî

This project uses two datasets containing applicant data and credit approval data, with the aim to determine which clients are *good* or *bad* based on historical credit data, as well as creating a machine learning model than can reliably classify new customers into each categories.


---


## Setup & environment ‚öô

This project has been created and run using **Python 3.8.8**. It must be kept in mind that some of the needed ML libraries are changing on a regular basis, and some of those changes might eventually break some of the code.

All necessary libraries are included in the *credit-approval* notebook.

## Internal structure üìö

The project is structured into the following sections:

1. Data exploration.
2. Data cleaning.
3. Data wrangling.
4. PCA.
5. Data normalization & oversampling.
6. Pipeline and model creation.
7. Model evaluation.
8. Model optimization.

## Notes and warnings ‚Åâ

This notebook uses many machine learning libraries which are in constant evolution, and this fact might at some point break the code of certain sections. Copy & paste is therefore allowed, but not encouraged if you want to replicate the same results.
